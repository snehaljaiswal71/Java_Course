OOP :- Object oriented programming : - ANy real time entity which we convert into an programming that is OOP

* what are the pillars of oops / basics of oops
   :- INheritance
    :- Abstration
	:-Encapsulation   , modifiers   , Operators , Arrays
	:- Poly-morphism
	
	:- INheritance   :- We can access all the methods and  variable from parent class into child classes
	  Single, multi-level , multiple 
	  :- wenever we  are dealing with  inheriatnce we need to create extends  keyword
	  
	  :- benefit of using inheriatnce is code re-usability
	  
	  
	*****  we can create the objects using new
	
	
	Two types of keyword static and non static
	
	**** multiple inheriatnce is not supported is java
	   example :- if both classes has same functianlity that time  object can get confusie
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   Abstration   :- It hides internal complex data and shows the functinality to the users 
	   
	   How we can achieve Abstration  by two ways interface and abscract class 
	   
	   abscract class :- we can use abscract methods and normal/concret method
	   
	   Suppose we needs to achieve 0 to 100 % absctractions then we should go with abstrct class
	   or else we can use  interface.
	   
	   using interface we can achieve directly 100% interface abstarctions

	   Github :- 
	   Clone :- git clone https://github.com/snehaljaiswal71/Java_Course.git
	   cd Java_Course/
	   git checkout -b feature/task_name       // using -b we can create own branch
	   git status                    // we can check which file we need to  commit
	   git add .                  // add the files  on server
	   git commit -m "txt file"    // commit files -m "msg"
	   git push               // merged to servers
	   
	   
	   
	   Access Modifier
	    :- Public , private , defaut  ,protected
		
		public whenvener method /  variable /  class  once u declare u can use anywhere
		private :- we can access only inside that class 
		default :- we can access within  the same package , if we haven`t metion any modifiers ,
		it will take it as default
		protected :- we can use within same package if we want to use in different using child class we can call 
		it .
		
		Two types of keyword static and non static
	
	**** multiple inheriatnce is not supported is java
	   example :- if both classes has same functianlity that time  object can get confusie

	   Suppose we needs to achieve 0 to 100 % absctractions then we should go with abstrct class
	   or else we can use  interface.
	   
	   using interface we can achieve directly 100% abstractions
	   
	   
	   Poly-morphism  :- Poly means many and morphism mean forms ,so we can acheive it ny many ways
	   Overloading (compile time Poly-morphism )  / overriding (run time Poly-morphism )
	   // by writing muliple methods we can achive it.
	   
	   
	   //Loops
	   for  , do while loop , while loop , forEach loop 
	   
	   Multi-threading 
	   
	   
	   we can performed on funtioanlities , so that muliple threads can access those things
	   
	   How we can create Thread class
	   1) extending Thread class
	   2) Runnable Interface
	   
	   whenever we are creating thread it will look for run method and start the thread 
	   
	   can we start same thread twice 
	   No, java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException exception will occured
	   
	   by using extending Thread class , we can not extends any another class , because multiple Inhreritace is not supported
	   by implementing Runnable interface , we can extends any class and used it .
	   
	   synchronization
	     multiple user cannot access those funtioanlities at the same time, they can access  it one by one .
		 
		 drawback 
		    by using synchronization we can consume a lot of time , so we cannot use it .

			Exceptions    :-  checked , unchecked exception ,Error
			
			** Errors we cannot handle
			
			Why we need exception :- our programms should run in normal way even if at some point excetion or any error occured .
			
			checked , unchecked exception ,Error
			
			checked exception will always checked at compilation level
			
			unchecked exception will checked at runutime
			
			Error :- system generated , not programmaticlay so we can not handle it .  ex :- MemoryOutOfBound 
			
			keyword :- try , catch , finally , throw , throws
			
			User define exceptions 
			
			Try blocked we  can write/ put statements which can give an error  so , catch blocked it can excute normally .
			
			
			Null pointer exceptions , Arthmatic exception , ArrayIndexOutofBound exception
			
			
			50    we are doing some operation of 50 data      , 15 , 20 
			
			we cannot write try block alone , we need to write catch block or finlly block
			
			we can write multiple catch block , but parent Exception will come in the last , why beacuse it will handle all kind of exceptions
			
			finlly block will always gets excuted , when it will not , if der is any system failure .
			
			Throw : - to  throw an exceptions , we can used it to throw custom exception / user define exception
			 and we can write it inside an method .
			 
			Throws :- we need to write with the method name  and In case of checked exception 
           If child class throws an checcked exceptions parent class method must throws same exception or it`s  parent exception that will be (Exception) .			
			
	   
	        
			COLLECTIONS :- We can deal with large number of records / data that time we can use collections
			
			 Employees () ID name salray number  age  number
			 
			 Collections :- List ,Set , Queue
			 
			 List :- list supported by duplicate records /  data
			         List supports insertion order 
					 Null values also will add in the insertion order
			      ArrayList :- arraylist to stored the elements

                 by deafult arraylist contain the size of 10 				  
				  
				   LinkedList  :- LinkedList  to get the elements and menupulates them            

				  Vector : - was introduced java 1.0 , 
			 
			 how we can removed duplicates from the list ..?
			 
			 Set :- Set supports only unioue records 
			       set does not supports insertion order 
				   Null value will always get the first position
			     Hashset,,TreeSet
			LinkedHashset :- it only supports insertion order 
			
			TreeSet  : - supports alphabatical Order
			 Null values will not supports
