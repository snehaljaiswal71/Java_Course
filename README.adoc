OOP :- Object oriented programming : - ANy real time entity which we convert into an programming that is OOP

* what are the pillars of oops / basics of oops
   :- INheritance
    :- Abstration
	:-Encapsulation   , modifiers   , Operators , Arrays
	:- Poly-morphism
	
	:- INheritance   :- We can access all the methods and  variable from parent class into child classes
	  Single, multi-level , multiple 
	  :- wenever we  are dealing with  inheriatnce we need to create extends  keyword
	  
	  :- benefit of using inheriatnce is code re-usability
	  
	  
	*****  we can create the objects using new
	
	
	Two types of keyword static and non static
	
	**** multiple inheriatnce is not supported is java
	   example :- if both classes has same functianlity that time  object can get confusie
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   Abstration   :- It hides internal complex data and shows the functinality to the users 
	   
	   How we can achieve Abstration  by two ways interface and abscract class 
	   
	   Suppose we needs to achieve 0 to 100 % absctractions then we should go with abstrct class
	   or else we can use  interface.
	   
	   using interface we can achieve directly 100% abstractions
