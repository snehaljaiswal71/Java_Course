OOP :- Object oriented programming : - ANy real time entity which we convert into an programming that is OOP

* what are the pillars of oops / basics of oops
   :- INheritance
    :- Abstration
	:-Encapsulation   , modifiers   , Operators , Arrays
	:- Poly-morphism
	
	:- INheritance   :- We can access all the methods and  variable from parent class into child classes
	  Single, multi-level , multiple 
	  :- wenever we  are dealing with  inheriatnce we need to create extends  keyword
	  
	  :- benefit of using inheriatnce is code re-usability
	  
	  
	*****  we can create the objects using new
	
	
	Two types of keyword static and non static
	
	**** multiple inheriatnce is not supported is java
	   example :- if both classes has same functianlity that time  object can get confusie
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   Abstration   :- It hides internal complex data and shows the functinality to the users 
	   
	   How we can achieve Abstration  by two ways interface and abscract class 
	   
	   abscract class :- we can use abscract methods and normal/concret method
	   
	   Suppose we needs to achieve 0 to 100 % absctractions then we should go with abstrct class
	   or else we can use  interface.
	   
	   using interface we can achieve directly 100% interface abstarctions

	   Github :- 
	   Clone :- git clone https://github.com/snehaljaiswal71/Java_Course.git
	   cd Java_Course/
	   git checkout -b feature/task_name       // using -b we can create own branch
	   git status                    // we can check which file we need to  commit
	   git add .                  // add the files  on server
	   git commit -m "txt file"    // commit files -m "msg"
	   git push               // merged to servers
	   
	   
	   
	   Access Modifier
	    :- Public , private , defaut  ,protected
		
		public whenvener method /  variable /  class  once u declare u can use anywhere
		private :- we can access only inside that class 
		default :- we can access within  the same package , if we haven`t metion any modifiers ,
		it will take it as default
		protected :- we can use within same package if we want to use in different using child class we can call 
		it .
		
		Two types of keyword static and non static
	
	**** multiple inheriatnce is not supported is java
	   example :- if both classes has same functianlity that time  object can get confusie
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   Abstration   :- It hides internal complex data and shows the functinality to the users 
	   
	   How we can achieve Abstration  by two ways interface and abscract class 
	   
	   Suppose we needs to achieve 0 to 100 % absctractions then we should go with abstrct class
	   or else we can use  interface.
	   
	   using interface we can achieve directly 100% abstractions
	   
	   
	   Poly-morphism  :- Poly means many and morphism mean forms ,so we can acheive it ny many ways
	   Overloading (compile time Poly-morphism )  / overriding (run time Poly-morphism )
	   // by writing muliple methods we can achive it.
	   
	   
	   //Loops
	   for  , do while loop , while loop , forEach loop 
	   
	   Multi-threading 
	   
	   
	   we can performed on funtioanlities , so that muliple threads can access those things
	   
	   How we can create Thread class
	   1) extending Thread class
	   2) Runnable Interface
	   
	   whenever we are creating thread it will look for run method and start the thread 
	   
	   can we start same thread twice 
	   No, java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException exception will occured
	   
	   by using extending Thread class , we can not extends any another class , because multiple Inhreritace is not supported
	   by implementing Runnable interface , we can extends any class and used it .
	   
	   synchronization
	     multiple user cannot access those funtioanlities at the same time, they can access  it one by one .
		 
		 drawback 
		    by using synchronization we can consume a lot of time , so we cannot use it .
			
			
			
			Airplane     5    3    5 thread    notify    seat are not availbe 
			
			
			
			
			Exceptions    :-  checked , unchecked exception ,Error
			
			** Errors we cannot handle
			
			Why we need exception :- our programms should run in normal way even if at some point excetion or any error occured .
			
			checked , unchecked exception ,Error
			
			checked exception will always checked at compilation level
			
			unchecked exception will checked at runutime
			
			Error :- system generated , not programmaticlay so we can not handle it .  ex :- MemoryOutOfBound 
			
			keyword :- try , catch , finally , throw , throws
			
			User define exceptions 
			
			Try blocked we  can write/ put statements which can give an error  so , catch blocked it can excute normally .
			
			
			Null pointer exceptions , Arthmatic exception , ArrayIndexOutofBound exception
			
			
			50    we are doing some operation of 50 data      , 15 , 20 
			
			we cannot write try block alone , we need to write catch block or finlly block
			
			we can write multiple catch block , but parent Exception will come in the last , why beacuse it will handle all kind of exceptions
			
			finlly block will always gets excuted , when it will not , if der is any system failure .
			
			Throw : - to  throw an exceptions , we can used it to throw custom exception / user define exception
			 and we can write it inside an method .
			 
			Throws :- we need to write with the method name  and In case of checked exception 
           If child class throws an checcked exceptions parent class method must throws same exception or it`s  parent exception that will be (Exception) .			
			
	   
	        
			COLLECTIONS :- We can deal with large number of records / data that time we can use collections
			
			 Employees () ID name salray number  age  number
			 
			 Collections :- List ,Set ,  map   ignore  Queue
			 
			 List :- list supported by duplicate records /  data
			         List supports insertion order 
					 Null values also will add in the insertion order
			      ArrayList :- arraylist to stored the elements

                 by deafult arraylist contain the size of 10 				  
				  
				   LinkedList  :- LinkedList  to get the elements and menupulates them            

				  Vector : - was introduced java 1.0 , 
			 
			 how we can removed duplicates from the list ..?
			 
			 Set :- Set supports only unioue records 
			       set does not supports insertion order 
				   Null value will always get the first position
			     Hashset,,TreeSet
			LinkedHashset :- it only supports insertion order 
			
			TreeSet  : - supports alphabatical Order
			 Null values will not supports
			 
			 can we add elements while iterating  :- No we will face concourrentmodificationexception
			 to avoid it we will go with CopyOnwriteArrayList
			 
			
			MAP works with key value pair
			  Map<key,value>  keys    
			  String s= "abc";
			       keys.put(1,s.concate("abchd"));
			
			   
0		list.add("Employe2");  
1		list.add("Employe3");
2		list.add("Employe5");
3		list.add("Employe4");
4		list.add("Employe1");
5		list.add("amnbd");
        list.add("Employe2");
6		                  list.add("Employe3");
7		list.add("Employe5");
8		list.add("Employe4");
9		list.add("Employe1");
10		list.add("Employe2");
		list.add("Employe3");
		list.add("Employe5");
		list.add("Employe4");
        
		list.add(5, "abcd");
		
		
		
		Map contains key value pair which sort it in basis of keys
 Hashmap , LinkedHashMap , TreeMap , HashTable

 map keys will always be unique , it will not allowed duplicates

 to iterate over the elements we need to convert into set

  one null key is alowed int map and values can be null

   how internally map checks if keys are duplicates or internal working of hashmap
   iternally we used Equals and Hashcode methods

   Set / Map does not supports null / null as key we will get NullPointerException

  If we face concurrentModificationException we can use CopyOnwriteArrayList / ConcurrentHashMap
   

  Vector/Hashtable is synchonized , mutiple thread / users cannot access those functionality at the same time


 
Collections :- List , Set , Map
   ArrayList/LinedList  , HashSet  , HashMap

   WAR removed duplicates from List but not using Set

   
    java 8
        :- Optional null
        :- Lambda    
         :- For loops
         : - Predicate
        :- Streams.filter
        :- function Interface

    Spring/SPringboot  mySQL/postmap

   Servelt / Jsp / Jdbc

  java 8

  Lambda expression :- bioler plat means less code we need to write , whereever we have 1 abstract class der
  we can Lambda expressions

  Syntax -- (->)


  stream().filter  will alwats work to collections



 Spring  Core       /   Spring MVC  / Spring AOP / Security /  DAO / spring batch   :- springboot
   
  We don`t need to create the objects
  while using spring we can achieve fully abstrations

   Spring works on IOC / DI

   Inversion of Control  -- container   :-  ApplicationCOntext , BeanFacotry
   We don`t need to create the objects  , it will create beans , inisiazize beans , dispose the beans
   DI - Dependacy Injection
   We dont need to create an object instead of that we will tell which bean is going to use by beans and class names
   
   how to access the variables
   Getter/Setter :- Property   , optional fileds we can write
   Contsructor :-   Contsructor arg   , manditory fields needs to write

  spring scopes
   singleton :- by default singleton , it will create only one object for whole application
   prototype :-  it will create object each time we call it
   sessions :-  it will create object per sessions
   GlobalSessions :-  it will create object per global sessions



     
   SPring AOP

   (Aspect Oriented Programming)
      we can divide program logic into small parts , and we can insert it at any point   .. cross cutting concerns

    before :- methods should get executed before our main method
    After :- methods should get executed after our main method
    Around :- methods should get executed before and after our main method

 annotations  @Component on the class level  vs  !--  <bean id="logAspect" class="c in xml file

  AOP we are using for logging Purpose
 

    we will used logging level in whole applications we can used it .
   
    MVC   :- Spring MVC   (Model View Controller)

     COntroller that handles both Model and view
    Model -- Bussiness logics which we need to write
    View  -- we want it to display to customers

Employee
    Controller class that contains @Controller

     GET   :- get the data based on Ids
     POST :-  TO add some data
     Delete :- delete the data  ids
     Put  :- update the data ids
   
     Model :-  Bussiness logic @Service

     call will come to this @RequestMapping  


    How the MVC Flows works
: - dispatcherServlet  --- > Controllers  --- > ( RequestMapping )Model data takes bussiness logics  --- > view to display it

   @Component :- is fpor the bean
   @Autowire to use it inside the class
